# Scanner Parser Lab Project

This repository contains a expression evaluator implemented in Python. It can parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions with support for conditional statements (if, then, else).

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Gradio (for the GUI interface)

## Usage
Input Format
The supported input format for expressions is:

Arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /
Comparison operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
Variables: Alphanumeric identifiers
Constants: Numerical values
Example Expressions
if 5<=5 then 5+5 else 5-5
2 * (3 + 4) / (5 - 1)
x = 10 * y + 5
Output Format
The output will display the evaluated result of the input expression or an error message if the input is invalid.

## Code Structure
